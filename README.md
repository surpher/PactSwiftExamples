[![PactSwift demo projects (macOS 11)](https://github.com/surpher/pact-swift-examples/actions/workflows/test_projects-macOS11.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/surpher/pact-swift-examples/actions/workflows/test_projects-macOS11.yml)

Example projects using [PactSwift][pactswift] framework.

Note that using Carthage may require you to use the [workaround script][carthage-script].

## What? How? Huh?

1. Clone this repo
2. cd into a project you're interested in
3. Fire up your Xcode 12+
4. Wait for either SPM dependencies to resolve, or run `carthage update --use-xcframeworks` if the project is set up with a `Cartfile` (mind the issues with Silicon platform)
5. Run tests
6. Happy days! ðŸŽ‰
